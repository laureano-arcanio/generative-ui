    **Business Idea Pitch:**

    **Name:** *SkillSprout – AI-Powered Microlearning for Professionals*

    **Overview:**
    SkillSprout is a personalized, AI-driven microlearning platform designed to help busy professionals upskill in just 5–10 minutes a day. Think of it as “Duolingo for workplace skills,” but smarter. It delivers highly focused lessons on in-demand topics—like data storytelling, emotional intelligence, UX writing, and Python scripting—tailored to the user’s career path, learning style, and schedule.

    **Problem:**
    Professionals want to grow, but they’re drowning in tasks and meetings. Traditional courses are too long, generic, and hard to finish. Teams lack time, and companies waste L\&D budgets on tools employees don’t use.

    **Solution:**
    SkillSprout offers bite-sized, interactive lessons that adapt daily based on user feedback, progress, and real-world use cases. It uses an AI tutor to provide instant feedback, simulate practical scenarios, and keep users engaged. Companies get a dashboard to track team progress and identify knowledge gaps.

    **Target Audience:**
    • Professionals aged 25–45 in tech, marketing, and business
    • Companies (B2B SaaS, agencies, startups) looking to invest in low-cost, high-impact training

    **Revenue Model:**
    • Freemium individual plan
    • \$12/month Pro plan with advanced features
    • Enterprise tier with admin tools, content customization, and Slack integration

    **Differentiator:**
    We combine LLM-powered content generation, gamified microlearning, and role-specific learning paths to reduce skill-building friction to near zero.

    **Why Now:**
    Remote work, rapid tech shifts, and AI disruption are forcing employees to constantly upskill. SkillSprout meets this demand with a platform built for modern attention spans.

    **Next Steps:**
    We’re currently building the MVP using React, FastAPI, and OpenAI APIs. Launching a private beta with 50 users in 60 days. Seeking \$50k pre-seed to cover dev, testing, and early traction.

    Would you like a one-pager or mockup for this idea?

    Business Idea: LoopNest – Modular Furniture for Tiny Spaces
    I’m launching LoopNest, a brand focused on modular, multi-functional furniture designed specifically for people living in small urban apartments. Each piece is designed to transform—like a coffee table that turns into a desk, or a bench that unfolds into a bed. Clean design, easy assembly, and sustainable materials are at the core.
    I’m starting with a few core pieces and working with a local carpenter to prototype. Planning to test interest via Instagram and local pop-ups, then scale based on feedback. It’s early days, but I’m obsessed with solving the space issue for modern city living.
    Want to hear how I’m planning the first product drop?
